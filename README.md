# Makesmith-joystick
Control a MakesmithCNC machine with a simple analog joystick.

The MakesmithCNC machine was a Kickstarter project in 2014 to make an extremely
low-cost desktop CNC router, using a laser-cut plywood structure and a closed-loop
servo-driven motion system controlled by an Arduino Mega 2560 equipped with a custom
driver board. After building the kit, I concluded that it wasn't going to be practical
as a CNC router, and set it aside. In early 2017, it occurred to me that the machine
would be usable as a platform for an inexpensive USB microscope. For that application,
none of the CNC control features were needed, just a simple interactive joystick to
allow the operator to position the microscope with respect to the work.

## Getting Started

Connect a two-axis analog joystick with an integrated pushbutton (I used Adafruit
product 512) to +5V, GND, A15 (X), A14 (Y), and A13 (button) on the MakesmithCNC's
Arduino board.

Program the Arduino with this sketch. Now the machine is under joystick control.
Press the button on the joystick to enable X/Y control of the machine. Press the button
again to enable Z axis (focus) control.

If you're using a USB microscope with the machine, mount it where the spindle motor
would go, and connect it via USB according to the microscope's instructions.

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
* a MakesmithCNC desktop CNC router, assembled and working
* a computer with the Arduino development environment on it
* a 2-axis analog joystick with a button, like Adafruit #512
* some wire
